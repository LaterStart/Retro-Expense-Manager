# Retro-Expense-Manager
Final assignment project

Idea was to build complex CMD application from scratch without help of any external libraries, for educational purposes.
Retro Expense Manager is "simulated" financial application, that helps user to track his everyday financial transactions.
It's built upon MVC design pattern, with custom modified relations. Data records are stored in raw binary format. Used data structure for data file is double linked list. Application has exchange rate feature, connecting to online exchange rate API, downloading most recent exhange rates. Altought application is CMD app, it has simulated GUI elements, which enable user to use and browse application with his keyboard.
