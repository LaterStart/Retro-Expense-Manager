# Retro-Expense-Manager
Student final assignment project (My first project)

Idea was to build complex CMD application from scratch without help of any external libraries, for educational purposes.
Final assigment project assgiment was to research developement process of an application using C++ language. Additionally it covered some of the design principles and patterns while trying to implement custom simple database system.

Retro Expense Manager is "simulated" financial application, that helps user to track his everyday financial transactions.
It's built upon MVC design pattern, with custom modified relations. Data records are stored in raw binary format. Used data structure for data file is double linked list. Application has networking feature, downloading data from an exchange rate API. Altought application is CMD app, it has simulated GUI elements, which enable user to use and browse application with his keyboard.

- Current version: 2.1
